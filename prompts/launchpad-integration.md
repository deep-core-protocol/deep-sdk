# Coding-agent prompt — run a Launchpad on DeepCore

Paste the block below into a coding agent (Claude Code or any other) inside the repository you
want the Launchpad in. **Fill in `## My setup` first.** MIT, like the SDK it ships with.

A launch on DeepCore is one transaction: `LaunchpadKitV2.createLaunch` creates the token, opens
one or two pools on DeepCore's shared core (a single-sided CL range and/or a shaped Bin
distribution), configures the launch guard and locks the liquidity. You deploy none of it. The
kit, the guards and the lockers are already on chain; you call them.

---

## Before you paste

Four facts shape the whole integration. An agent that does not know them writes plausible code
that loses money.

1. **Every duration is seconds, measured by `block.timestamp`.** Fee decay, start delay and tax
   expiry are all seconds. Nothing in Kit v2 takes a block count, so no block time is ever
   needed. The anti-snipe decay has a floor of 60 seconds, on purpose: a sequencer may move
   timestamps by a few seconds, and a shorter window could be skipped.
2. **The launch guard takes its fee and the creator tax in the QUOTE currency**, as a hook delta,
   not as the pool's LP fee. Anything that reads the pool's LP fee sees a small number or zero;
   the real charge is the guard's, and the SDK reads it (`readGuardFeeParts`, `guardBuyCharges`).
3. **A buy the launch range cannot fill completely reverts** with the guard's `SwapNotFilled`.
   Size every buy from a quote, never "spend all of it and see". `decodeSwapNotFilled` turns the
   revert into the two numbers that explain it.
4. **Fee-on-transfer and rebasing tokens are not supported**, as the quote or anywhere else.
   Refuse them in the UI.

## The prompt

````text
I am building a token Launchpad on DeepCore Protocol. `LaunchpadKitV2` is already deployed on my
chain and does the whole launch in one call. I am NOT deploying the kit, the guards or the lockers.

## My setup

- Chain: HyperEVM (999)                  <-- or BNB Chain 56, Robinhood Chain 4663, Base 8453
- Quote token: <symbol>                   <-- what launches trade against (native or an ERC-20 from the token list)
- My fee wallet: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000   <-- REPLACE. Not optional: a zero
  recipient does not revert, it forfeits the revenue. Refuse to wire it and ask me for a real address.
- Tenant: none | my Launchpad's DeepCorePad address   <-- see rule 6

## Ground rules — follow these exactly

1. ADDRESSES AND LAUNCH MATHS COME FROM THE SDK. NEVER HAND-ROLL EITHER.

   npm install @deepcoreprotocol/sdk viem

   import {
     getDeployment, requireContract, DEEPCORE_CHAIN_IDS,
     readKitV2Limits, buildLaunchV2, validateLaunchParamsV2,
     readKitV2Launches, readKitV2Earnings, readTenantConfig,
     openingPriceFromMarketCap, resolveNativeUsd,
     readGuardFeeParts, guardBuyCharges, largestExactInputFor, decodeSwapNotFilled,
     readGuardGeneration, PRESET, NO_TAX, LAUNCH_TAX_LIMITS,
   } from "@deepcoreprotocol/sdk"

   const d = getDeployment(999)       // undefined on a chain DeepCore has no record for: say so in the UI
   if (!d) throw new Error("DeepCore is not on this chain yet")
   const kit = d.launchpadV2.launchpadKitV2   // Address | null; null means not on this chain

   `null` in the address book means "not on this chain". It is never the zero address and must
   never be treated as one. Never paste a hex address into source: every contract is in the book.

2. BUILD THE CALL WITH `buildLaunchV2`, NOT BY ENCODING `createLaunch` YOURSELF.

   const limits = await readKitV2Limits(client, kit, { tenant })   // or { direct: {...} } with no tenant
   const built  = await buildLaunchV2(client, kit, draft, limits)

   `buildLaunchV2` predicts the launch token's address and cross-checks it against the kit
   (`predictLaunchTokenChecked`), snaps the opening price to what each leg can really open at,
   validates the whole call against the kit's and the guards' own bounds, and returns
   `{ to, data, value, issues, legs, token }`.

   - Any issue with `severity: "error"` means the kit would revert. Do not send. Show it.
   - Show `legs[i].openingPrice` (the SNAPPED price the pool is born at) and `snapFraction`.
     That number, not the one the user typed, is what the contract uses.
   - Send exactly `built.value`. It is the kit's "safe value": a launch-fee increase scheduled
     behind its notice cannot make the call revert, and any surplus is refunded in the same call.

3. OPEN AT A MARKET CAP, NOT AT A TYPED PRICE.

   Ask the creator for an opening market cap and turn it into a price with
   `openingPriceFromMarketCap`, using a native/USD price from `resolveNativeUsd` (Chainlink on
   chain first, then other on-chain sources). Show where the price came from. If no source
   answers, default in native units and say there is no USD price; never invent one. A launch's
   opening price cannot be changed after the pool exists, and its liquidity is locked forever.

4. SIMULATE THE EXACT BYTES, SHOW THEM, THEN SEND. In that order.

   `eth_call` `{ to: built.to, data: built.data, value: built.value, from: launcher }` before
   enabling the button. Disable the button until it simulates. Show: the token address, every
   leg's pool and opening price, the fee schedule (initial fee, final fee, decay in seconds,
   start time), the tax if any, the lock split, and the launch fee in native.

5. THE ANTI-SNIPE SCHEDULE AND THE CREATOR TAX HAVE HARD LIMITS. READ THEM, DO NOT HARDCODE THEM.

   `limits` carries every cap the contracts enforce: the initial fee (up to 50% on a CL leg, 10% on
   a Bin leg), decay at least 60 seconds, start delay at most 30 days, a tax of at most 10% per
   side that expires within 180 days, the protocol's minimum share. Use `PRESET` by name; a
   bare `0` is `Custom`, which reads the schedule fields directly and, left at zero, launches
   with no protection and no error. `NO_TAX` is the explicit "no tax" value.

   The configuration freezes at the first swap, or when the clock passes the start time,
   whichever is first. After that nobody can change the schedule or the tax.

6. TENANT TERMS ARE STORED ON CHAIN. A LAUNCH RESTATES THEM EXACTLY.

   If I run a Launchpad (a `DeepCorePad`), its integrator share, integrator launch fee, tax caps
   and allowed quotes are read with `readTenantConfig(client, kit, tenant)` and passed through
   `readKitV2Limits(..., { tenant })`. The integrator is my fee wallet. A launch sent with no
   tenant pays no tenant terms: tenant fees are a default, not an enforcement.

7. WHO EARNS WHAT, AND IN WHICH CURRENCY.

   - The guard's trade fee and the creator tax are taken in the quote currency on buys AND sells.
     On a buy, 20% of the trade fee goes to the pool's liquidity (and so to the locked position,
     by the lock's split); the rest is the guard's, split creator / protocol / integrator by the
     launch's frozen split (protocol at least 20%).
   - The tax is split by its own frozen buckets (protocol at least 10%).
   - Earnings are pull-claimed. `readKitV2Launches` then `readKitV2Earnings(client, scan, account)`
     lists what an account can collect and claim; build the claim screen from it.
   - A guard keeps ONE claimable balance per account and currency, shared by fee and tax. Never add
     a "fee claimable" to a "tax claimable".

8. BUYS ARE SIZED FROM A QUOTE.

   A buy that the launch range cannot fill reverts with `SwapNotFilled` (the guard refuses a
   partial fill because it has already charged the amount named). Use `largestExactInputFor` to
   cap the input, and decode any revert with `decodeSwapNotFilled(revertData)` to tell the user
   how much the pool could take. Show the guard's fee and the tax as their own lines
   (`guardBuyCharges`), never folded into price impact.

9. TRADES GO THROUGH DEEPCORE'S ROUTER, AND EVERY ROUTER TRANSACTION IS VERIFIED.

   import { DeepCoreRouterClient, verifySwapCalldata } from "@deepcoreprotocol/sdk/router"
   const router = new DeepCoreRouterClient({ baseUrl: "https://api.deepcore.fun" })

   `router.swap(...)` checks the transaction's target against the SDK's own address book and
   decodes the calldata. If you build a transaction any other way from the API's answer, call
   `verifySwapCalldata(kind, tx, request)` yourself before the wallet sees it. It refuses any
   calldata that does anything but the swap that was asked for. Never sign router calldata you
   did not verify.

10. NEVER RENDER A NUMBER YOU DID NOT READ.

   Every figure comes from the chain, the SDK's address book and token list, or the public API
   (`https://api.deepcore.fun/v1/...`, e.g. `/v1/launches`, `/v1/chains/:chainId/pools/:poolId`).
   No mock data, no sample series. Four distinct states per panel: loading, error, empty,
   not available on this chain. Two trades are not a chart: say the count.

## Build this

1. Wallet connection and a chain guard.
2. The launch wizard: name, symbol, metadata, supply, opening market cap, legs (CL range and/or
   Bin shape), preset, optional tax, review with the snapped prices, simulate, send.
3. The launch list (`readKitV2Launches`, or `/v1/launches`) with each launch's phase and live fee.
4. The earnings screen for creators and for my fee wallet (`readKitV2Earnings`).
5. A token page with a buy/sell box that uses the router and rule 8.

## When you are done

Do not tell me it works. Show me a simulated `createLaunch` against the live chain with zero
error issues, the list reading real launches, and every screen state you implemented. If
something is not wired, say which and why.
````

---

## What to check before you trust the output

- `grep -r "0x" src` finds nothing but your fee wallet and test fixtures.
- The wizard's button stays disabled when the simulation fails, and the issue list explains why.
- A buy larger than the range reverts in simulation and the UI says how much would fit.
- Turn the RPC off and reload: you see an error state that names the problem, not a chart.
