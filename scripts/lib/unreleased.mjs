 * contracts' deployment and read-back.
 *
 * Used by `scripts/sync-public-repo.mjs` (on `src/`) and by the npm staging step (on `dist/`).
 * Both strip the same three things: the module's directory, its `package.json` subpath export,
 * and every re-export of it from the root index. Then they ASSERT nothing still names it, so a
 * new re-export written in a form this regex misses fails the release instead of shipping a
 * root index that imports a file which is not there.
 *
 * The address-book fields reserved for these contracts (`rangeOrders`, `dca`, `vaultFactory`,
 * `lpRewardsHook`, `oracleHook`, `dexHook`, `tunerGate`) stay in the types: they are `null` or
 * absent on every chain, and the address-book data and its type must not disagree.
