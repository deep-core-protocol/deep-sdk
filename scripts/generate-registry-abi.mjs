/**
 * Emits the hook-registry ABIs the SDK's `registry` module reads and encodes.
 *
 * Same licence firewall as `generate-events.mjs` and `generate-launchpad-abi.mjs`:
 * this reads the *ABI JSON* out of the Foundry build artifacts of the
 * GPL-licensed Solidity packages and emits MIT-licensed TypeScript. It never
 * reads Solidity sources, comments or NatSpec, so nothing expressive crosses the
 * boundary.
 *
 * Two constants, deliberately:
 *
 * - `DEEPCORE_HOOK_REGISTRY_ABI` is the whole deployed surface. Unlike the
 *   launchpad kit, the registry has no internal plumbing worth hiding - every
 *   function on it is a view a listing UI wants or a state change a curator
 *   makes, and the inherited AccessControl members are how a UI discovers who
 *   may curate. Curating this one would only mean re-curating it every time the
 *   contract grows a view.
 * - `DEEPCORE_HOOK_REGISTRY_EVENTS_ABI` is the six events declared by
 *   `IDeepCoreRegistry`, without the inherited role-management events. That is
 *   the exact set an indexer needs to rebuild registry state from logs, so it is
 *   worth having as its own log-filter-sized constant.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/generate-registry-abi.mjs [--check]
