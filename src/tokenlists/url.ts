   Where the DeepCore token lists are published.

   The lists are generated in the monorepo (`packages/tokenlists`) from the
   SDK address book and the verified stock registry, and PUBLISHED from a
   separate public repository so a third party can pin, fork or PR them
   without touching the protocol code:

       https://github.com/deep-core-protocol/token-list

   One file per chain, served raw from the default branch, and the
   logos beside them under `logos/<chainId>/<address>.png`.

   Nothing here points at the website domain
   (it was a placeholder domain), and a list
   URL that does not resolve is a list nobody can load. An app that serves its
   own copy passes its base; the dapp reads `VITE_DEEPCORE_TOKENLIST_BASE` for
   local development.
