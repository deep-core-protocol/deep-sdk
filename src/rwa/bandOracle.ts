   A VERIFIED CHAINLINK EQUITY FEED -> `ChainlinkPriceBandAdapter.configureFeed`
   AND `MarketHoursModule.configureMarket`, WITH THE CHECKS THOSE CONTRACTS MAKE.

   `ChainlinkPriceBandAdapter` has existed for a while with no real feed to point at.
   This is the missing half: it turns a record from `deployments/stockFeeds.ts` into the
   exact arguments the two contracts take, and refuses — here, in TypeScript, before
   anything is signed — every input they would refuse on chain, plus two they cannot
   check for themselves.

   THE TWO THIS FILE CHECKS AND THE CONTRACTS CANNOT
   -------------------------------------------------
   `baseIsCurrency0`. The adapter's own comment says it: "This is the field that
   inverts the band if it is wrong. It is not derivable here - this contract never sees
   the pool's tokens." It IS derivable from a pool key, because a PoolKey sorts its
   currencies, so `baseIsCurrency0` is `stockToken < quoteToken` by address. That is
   what `baseIsCurrency0For` does, and passing the two token addresses is always better
   than asserting the boolean by hand.

   THE BAND FLOOR. A price band narrower than the feed's own deviation threshold halts
   the pool on the feed's NORMAL behaviour. Chainlink publishes a new round when the
   price moves by `thresholdPercent` (0.5% for most equity feeds) or when the heartbeat
   expires, whichever comes first - so between rounds the reference is expected to sit
   up to that far from the market. A 0.3% band around a reference that is allowed to be
   0.5% wrong is a pool that stops trading for reasons no operator will be able to
   explain. `bandFloorPpm` is that floor; `marketSettingsFor` refuses anything under it.

   The floor is a FLOOR, not a recommendation. The reference is also up to `heartbeat`
   old, and a tokenised equity gapping over a weekend moves far more than 0.5%; see
   `WEEKEND` below and `rwa/marketHours.ts`.

   WEEKEND
   -------
   A `us_equities_24/5` feed stops publishing at the Friday close and resumes after the
   Sunday open. With `heartbeat` at the feed's own 86,400 s, the adapter reverts
   `AnswerTooOld` for the whole closure — correct, since the session gate has shut the
   pool anyway — and ALSO for the first moments after the weekly open, until the feed
   prints its first round of the week. Widening `heartbeat` to cover the closure is
   possible (the adapter's ceiling is 7 days) and is the WRONG trade: it lets the first
   swap of the week band against a reference from before the weekend gap, which is
   exactly the reference an equity's weekend news has invalidated. `weekendTolerant`
   exists so the choice is explicit; it defaults to false and says why in `warnings`.
