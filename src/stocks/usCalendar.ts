   THE US EQUITY CLOCK: which session the US stock market is in at an instant,
   and when a feed's session last ended.

   A premium is only honest when it says WHAT it compares against. During a live
   session a tokenised-stock price is compared with the feed's live print; when the
   market is shut it is compared with the last print before the close, and the board
   says "vs last close". Both need the exchange calendar, so it lives here.

   THE CALENDAR IS A TRANSCRIPTION, NOT A RULE. Holidays and early closes are the
   exchange's published list (https://www.nyse.com/markets/hours-calendars, read
   2026-10-13, section "Holidays and Trading Hours"), New York calendar dates. A year
   that is not listed has NO data: `calendarCovered` is false and a caller must not
   guess (the premium module refuses to compare). Add a year by reading the page,
   never by computing Easter.

   SESSIONS (New York local time, the regular ones from the exchange, the extended
   ones from Chainlink's own `us_equities_24/5` schedule, quoted in
   `rwa/marketHours.ts`):
     overnight  20:00 the evening before a trading day -> 04:00
     pre        04:00 -> 09:30
     open       09:30 -> 16:00 (13:00 on an early-close day)
     after      close -> 20:00
     closed     weekends, and the evening before a non-trading day
     holiday    a listed exchange holiday (its whole New York date)
   An early close moves the regular close only; the after-hours window still ends at
   20:00. That is an approximation stated here rather than hidden: NYSE's footnote
   says the late sessions of its other venues close at 17:00 on those days, and
   Chainlink publishes no early-close variant of the 24/5 schedule.
