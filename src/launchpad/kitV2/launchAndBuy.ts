/* ============================================================================
   A launch and the creator's first buy, in one transaction:
   `DeepCoreLaunchAndBuy.launchAndBuy(params, buy)`.

   The contract is a plain caller of `LaunchpadKitV2.createLaunch`, so the
   launch itself is exactly what `buildLaunchV2` builds. Three things differ,
   and each is handled here rather than left to a screen:

     * THE TOKEN ADDRESS MOVES. Through this contract the kit's caller is the
       contract, which folds the real caller into the salt itself:
       `kit.predictLaunchToken(launchAndBuy, keccak256(abi.encode(launcher, userSalt)))`.
       The contract's own `predictLaunchToken(launcher, userSalt)` is the
       authority; both routes are read and must agree before any pool id is
       derived from the address, and the address is passed back to the contract
       as `expectedToken`, which it checks before it creates anything.
     * THE START IS NOW. The contract refuses a delayed start
       (`StartDelayMustBeZero`): the buy lands at the open, at the opening fee.
     * TWO BOUNDS. `maxLaunchFeeWei` is the limits' `safeValue` (the kit is paid
       the fee in force, read in the same call), and `maxLpFeePips` is the fee
       the schedule opens at (`openingFeePips`, the contract's own
       `previewOpeningFee` rule). The guard's fee and any creator tax come out
       of `amountIn` before the pool trades, so `minAmountOut` is a real bound:
       read it by simulating with 0 and send what the simulation bought.

   `msg.value` is the launch value plus `amountIn` for a natively quoted leg; for
   an ERC-20 quote the contract pulls `amountIn` from the sender, who must have
   approved it (`approval`). Nothing here sends anything.
